                    <h2>Demographics</h2>
                    <p class="demo">Until the early 1990s, most residents lived near the Praia Grande beach, mainly
                        concentrated in the region between the beach of Boqueir√£o, where is located the city center and
                        beach Ocian. However, from the mid-1990s, the construction boom, which occurred through a series
                        of infrastructure works, landscaping and urbanization, which until then were too poor,
                        eventually attracting thousands of families in the municipality, search of jobs with contractors
                        and builders, causing a huge swelling population in the region between the current South
                        Expressway, the Highway Padre Manoel da N√≥brega and Serra do Mar creating suburbs, as Jardim
                        Quietude, Ribeiropolis, Jardim Samambaia, among others, but now, since all are in the process of
                        urbanization with schools, kindergartens, public transport and flooring in most of its streets,
                        as well as future investments made by the city size at these sites, such as 16 million dollars
                        to be invested in the suburb Glory, in its complete redevelopment.</p>

                    <p class="res">Praia Grande is one of 15 cities considered spas by S√£o Paulo state, which complied
                        with certain prerequisites set by State Law. There are other cities that are not spas, they are
                        still tourist resorts. This status ensures these municipalities a larger budget from the state
                        through the Department of Field Support Offices of the State of S√£o Paulo for the promotion of
                        regional tourism. Also, the municipality acquires the right to add your name next to the title
                        of Bathing Resort (Portuguese: Est√¢ncia Balne√°ria), term by which is designated by both the
                        municipal official or expedient for the reference state.</p>

                <section class="history">
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p class="hist">Although the political emancipation is recent, the area covered today by the
                        municipality of Praia Grande was one of the first areas colonized by the Portuguese, which began
                        with the arrival of Martim Afonso in 1532. The first village founded by the explorer, sent by
                        the Portuguese crown, was that of S√£o Vicente, which remained part Praia Grande until 1967.

                        After emancipation, the city slightly accelerated the pace of growth experienced since the
                        1950s, earning a higher quality in their public services, given the proximity of the municipal
                        government with the reality of the local population. In the 1980s, the city gained new impetus
                        to its growth with the opening of the Ponte do Mar Pequeno [Small Sea Bridge] (in the final
                        stretch of the Rodovia dos Imigrantes), linking the island of S√£o Vicente in the city, and
                        solving two problems at once: as well as relieve traffic on saturated Ponte Pensil[Suspension
                        Bridge], the city gained a direct link to the capital without the need of going through the
                        cities of Santos and S√£o Vicente, in order to access the Via Anchieta,[4] then the only option
                        to reach the capital. Thus, Praia Grande became the resort closest to the capital.

                        However, this ease of access has brought great inconvenience, that they would be solved by 1993
                        when the city started a revolution: the transport system has been completely refurbished, more
                        than 90% of the streets were paved, the sewage began an expansion of collection (which began
                        with 60% of households by 2012 and reach 100%), being treated and thrown more than 3 km from the
                        coast, the edge of the beach and the main tourist spots were completely re-urbanized, it was
                        forbidden to input bus tours without prior authorization from the municipality, the road system
                        has been completely revised and reconfigured on interventions that occurred until 2006.

                        Some projects are still to be deployed in the city, regardless of the administration, such as
                        airport charges in the region of Andaragu√°, State college campuses (UNESP) and Federal
                        (UNIFESP), the transformation of municipal landfill in ecological park (awaiting decontamination
                        of the soil) and Route 700, linking the Anhanguera to Rodovia dos Imigrantes.</p>
