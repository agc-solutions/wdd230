        <!-- The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing 
            what services and information will be provided. The client typically drives this content
            by stating functional specifications. It is OK to be less formal than this given example.
            Provide at least two purposes for having the website developed and running. -->

                specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target

            compatibility, and the overall aesthetic of your website. Additionally, always check
